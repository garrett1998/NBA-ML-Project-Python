Setup readme file

To use project correctly:

1. Pull from github and load into whatever python setup you have.
2. Do not change any of the file locations in the main project folder.
3. Set your python interpreter to run 'main.py'
4. If you did not change anything within the project folder, the project should now run correctly.

Note: It may throwback in error saying that you don't have "python module name here".
If this is the case you will just need to pip install the python modules needed

I used the following libraries:
1. csv 2. random 3. numpy 4. requests 5. bs4(BeautifulSoup4) 6. datetime

Some of these should already be installed, but if not these are all the libraries that may need to be installed

Thank you for checking out/using my repo!
